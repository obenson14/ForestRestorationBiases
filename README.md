# Forest Restoration Biases - Spatial Analysis Workflow
This repository conatains the Spatial Analysis workflow (designed to be run in Jupyter Notebooks) used as part of my MSc Environmental Modelling dissertation project at UCL, used to investigate the influence of surrounding landscape contexts (forest fragmentation and land use) across global restoration sites on the restoration method used.

- This repository is public while the dissertation project is being marked, before then being made private until the overall project it is contributing to is published, when it will be made public again, alongside the results dataset.

- In the code, placeholder datasets are used since they are currently stored locally on my personal device, and GEE project name is removed as well. 

- To run the code, the user will need a GEE kernel environment within Jupytern Notebooks (detailed in 'enironment.yml' and created using 'conda env create -f environments.yml', 'conda activate' in terminal), the requireed packages/libraries (detailed in 'requirements.txt', and install using 'pip install -r requirements.txt') and finally, a valid GEE account and project ID.
