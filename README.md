# Forest Restoration Biases - Spatial Analysis Workflow
This repository conatains the Spatial Analysis workflow (designed to be run in Jupyter Notebooks) used as part of my MSc Environmental Modelling dissertation project at UCL, used to investigate the influence of surrounding landscape contexts (forest fragmentation and land use) across global restoration sites on the restoration method used

- This repository is private while reserach is ongoing, and will be made public at a later date, as will the filtered dataset created and analysed as part of this project

- In the code, placeholder datasets are used since they are currently stored locally on my personal device, and GEE project name is removed as well.
