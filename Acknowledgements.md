- Firstly, the YouTube channel - Spatial eLearning (https://www.youtube.com/@spatialelearning) in setting up, navigating and effectively using GEE through a Python API setup like this, as well as providing a guide on a lot of the methods used throughout this script. 
- Secondly, code and data resources such as the GEE Community Catalogue (https://gee-community-catalog.org/) and the Google Earth Engine API Docs (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs) and Data Catalogue (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) as well as other references for packages and libraries such as 'pylandstats' or 'resterio' which were used in the analysis links for documentation can be found in the script.
- Finally, The creators of the GLC_FCS30D landcover data that's used for the spatial analysis in this script:

- I also acknowledge the use of AI through ChatGPT in an assistive role in building the code, specifically in helping to solve and understand key errors where learning new techniques and methods.
